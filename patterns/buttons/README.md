The buttons use our primary color, our text color, and our neutral color, for variety and to be easily visible. Each button has a specific purpose:

- The Standard buttons are for cards, forms, and footers.
- The Light buttons are for dark  background areas
- The Ghost buttons are for banners

"font-size" can be changed only to adapt to screen sizes.
